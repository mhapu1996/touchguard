# touchguard
project for nasa
Itâ€™s only a matter of time before we are able to go to Mars and see, touch and inspect things that have only been visible through the lenses of landers, rovers, and orbiters.
Now its time to visible it with our own eyes. To do so we need some assist of technology that can help us to live there
For living one of the main thing is water . In our cluster of multiple sensors we develop 
1.	a water finder by repurposing existing sensor on Earth know as humidity sensor
2.	moisture sensor that can detect water under the ground
3.	tem & pressure sensor thst can help people to live
4.	An repurposing gps system development on mars
